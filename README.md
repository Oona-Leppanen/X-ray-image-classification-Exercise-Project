# X-ray-image-classification-Exercise-Project
Summer 2024

This repository is still incomplete! All code files can be found from here but this README is still under development.

This exercise project is about doing CNN classification with X-ray images to differentiate Covid-19 patients from Pneumonia and healthy patients. For more information about the project check out the PDF.

Quick snapshot on results: The CNN model didn't learn at the end but with some modifications done to it the model would have learned very likely.
