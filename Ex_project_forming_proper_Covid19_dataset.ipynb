The training set consists of 70 healthy cases, 70 pneumonia cases and 111 covid cases and the test set consists of 20 healthy cases, 20 pneumonia cases and 26 covid cases. There is no inbuilt validation set so it must be created to train the CNN model properly in the main exercise project file.\n","\n","*COVID_IEEE* dataset has 1823 images divided into covid, normal and virus sets with 536, 668 and 619 images, respectively. The name 'normal' refers to healthy patients and the name 'virus' refers to pneumonia patients meaning pneumonia caused by viruses. Only the covid patients' images from this dataset are used in this project because the pneumonia and normal case images are from the dataset that's been used to train the base model and can't be therefore used to train, validate or test the fine-tuned model.\n","\n","Those covid case images from the *COVID_IEEE* dataset are divided into training set, validation set and test set and are added among the corresponding sets in the *Covid19-dataset* dataset to form together the Covid-19 dataset to be used to fine-tune the CNN model in the main exercise project
